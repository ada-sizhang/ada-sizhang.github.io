title: "Campaign-level off-Earth mining design and optimisation"
excerpt: "This project is to solve the problem of large-scale off-Earth mining. Off-Earth mining is an economic activity and requires detailed prefeasibility study. The work covers target selection, trajectory generation, mission opportunity search, economic analyses and campaign scheduling and optimization. "

## Introduction
Campaign level asteroid mining refers to the collection of scheduled missions, which are performed by one or multiple spacecraft, to explore and mine on one or multiple targets, and finally deliver the products to customers/space depots in different locations. Asteroid mining campaign design should consider different aspects of space mining; it needs to make decisions on overall strategies supported by mission-level details such as architecture, space/launch vehicle design, mining activity scheduling, logistics, economics, etc. 

The work is presented at 2021 AIAA SciTech Forum.
