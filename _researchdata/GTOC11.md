This database was created for GTOC 11. The database stores randomly generated time optimal low thrust trajectories. The trajectories are from the asteroids provided in GTOC 11 to a random 'Dyson Ring' station. This database was used to train Deep Neural Network models as surrogate of conventional time optimal optimization process. It take ephemerides and output optimal low thrust transfer time directly without performing actual optimization process.
