This database stores low-thrust roundtrip missions to NEAs. The generation of this database used our advanced deep learning low-thrust transfer cost approximation technique, which replace the conventional optimization process. The estimation of low thrust transfer cost is as fast as solving a Lambert problem. The search process is based on grid search.

## Methodology
### DNN â€“ Classifier
* Input: Classifier features, such as initial mass, time of flight, etc.
* Output: Two classes, representing feasible and infeasible Transfers
* Prediction Accuracy: ~ 98%
### DNN - Regressor
* Input: Regressor features, such as initial mass, time of flight, etc.
* Output: Single value of the predicted spacecraft final mass
* Prediction Mean Relative Error: < 1%
